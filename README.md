# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) challenges.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming puzzle is released at midnight EST (UTC-5). Each puzzle consists of two parts, with the second part unlocking after completing the first part.

## Repository Structure

Each day's solutions will be organized in their own directory.

## Running Solutions

Instructions for running solutions will be added as they are completed.
